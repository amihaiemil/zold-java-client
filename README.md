Java wrapper over Zold's RESTful API.

### Maven dependency

The library comes as a maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amihaiemil.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>zold-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**In order for it to work, you need to have an implementation of [JSON-P (JSR 374)](https://javaee.github.io/jsonp/index.html) in your classpath (it doesn't come transitively since most people are using Java EE APIs so, chances are it is already provided!).**

If you are not using Maven, you can also download the <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/com/amihaiemil/web/zold-java-client/0.0.3/zold-java-client-0.0.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar">fat</a> jar.
